iOS-Game-of-Life
================

LICENSE:

You can do whatever you like with this code.  

If you use it any apps it would be nice if you let me know and maybe put a link to my 
website, but that's not necessary (I'm just interested in what people will do with it)


What is it?
===========

A simple implementation of Conways Game of Life in objective C for iOS devices.

It will compile in xcode very straighforwardly.  Just load up the project and hit run to see it in the simulator.

1 tap on the screen will start the simulation, tapping again will restart

2 finger tap will create a shape, as will a 3 finger tap.

If you have an apple developer account you can pop in your provisioning profiles and it should run on the devices.
At least it does on mine!

TODO:
=====

Make the grid size variable depending on the device and the simulation resolution

Make a slide out menu or something to create the shapes, rather than the taps

Create a settings screen to allow the resolution of the simulation to be changed and to change colours 
and that kind of thing.
